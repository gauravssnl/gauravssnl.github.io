I have started learning Rust and I tried creating a project RServer which is an app for intercepting/capturing TCP requests sent by browser and other apps running on a system. While developing RServer , I faced an issue while trying to read the complete data from a TcpStream struct. TcpStream has only read method , but socket /TCP streams constructs do not have method such as read_all to read all the data from the stream. In this post, I am going to share my technique which I used in RServer . As we do not have any built-in method to read the TcpStream completely in one go , we obviously need to use some kind of loop to read the complete data from a given stream. Let us consider that we want to read all the data and we need to return the data and its length/size. /// Read the stream data and return stream data & its length fn read_stream ( stream : & mut TcpStream ) -> ( Vec , usize ) { let buffer_size = 512 ; let mut request_buffer = vec ! []; // let us loop & try to read the whole request data let mut request_len = 0 usize ; loop { let mut buffer = vec ! [ 0 ; buffer_size ]; match stream . read ( & mut buffer ) { Ok ( n ) => { if n == 0 { break ; } else { request_len += n ; // we need not read more data in case we have read less data than buffer size if n { println ! ( \"Error in reading stream data: {:?}\" , e ); break ; } } } ( request_buffer , request_len ) } Explanation : I have taken an initial buffer size as 512 as an example, we will be reading 512 bytes or lesser in one go from the stream. I have taken a mutable Vector here as we cannot determine the TcpStream data size/length in advance as we are reading data via network. Most of the other examples available might be using an array, but that might lead to either wastage of some space or there will be space scarcity to read all the data and store the data into the array as the size might be more or lesser than the required space. I am storing the length of the data which we read in a variable request_len . I am using a mutable temporary Vector variable buffer and try reading the 512 bytes inside a loop, then we are using a match pattern while reading the data to know the number of bytes of data which were read. Depending on the number of bytes read from TcpStream , which is n here, the corresponding code placed in the arm of the match block will be executed. If n is 0, i.e there is no data and nothing was read, we just need to break out of the loop and stop reading the stream. Otherwise, we just add the number of bytes read to the variable request_len . If n is lesser than the buffer size (512 here), we understand that the Stream has lesser data than our buffer size, we add the data how much ever it was there , by adding the mut buffer[..n] to the mutable vector request_buffer and then we break out of the loop as we have no more data under the current iteration of the loop. If n is equal to our buffer size ( 512 here), we read the data and add the data into mutable vector request_buffer . In this case, we don't break out of the loop and try reading more data out of the TcpStream if available . I hope this post will be useful to you all who are learning Rust socket / TcpStream programming . The same concept can be used for reading data from socket in other languages too.

This tutorial can be used either on Windows OS or on Linux OS. Steps 1. Install rustup which will install the rustc , cargo and other things required for Rust from its official website ( https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install ) . 2. Configure the PATH variable of your system so that you can invoke rustc , cargo and other rust related commands. Verify it by invoking these commands in terminal. 3. The successful installation of Rust can also be verified by invoking the command : rustc --version 4. If you are a Windows OS user, please install the Visual Studio C++ Build tools . You can also read my previous post regarding this, if you want to know the setup steps in details . 5. The next step is to verify that we are able to compile a HelloWorld program. To do that we can either manually write a Hello World program or use cargo to generate it. I will be using cargo to make this simple. To do that, use the command : cargo new hello 6. Navigate to the newly created directory ( hello in this case), and try compiling and running the program : cargo build && cargo run 7. Now, we need to setup a Text Editor for Rust development or we can use IDE. I prefer using Text Editor and I am using VSCode ( Visual Studio Code ) now a days. So, I will be setting up VSCode for Rust development such as syntax highlighting, auto completion, etc. 8. Open VSCode and click on Extensions and install the Rust Extension . 9. Restart the VSCode and start working with Rust code and projects and we will see the features of auto completion, syntax highlighting, etc. 10. Enjoy Rust programming and keep on learning Rust now :) I hope this tutorial will be useful to you all. Let me know if you have any questions regarding this tutorial or if you want to ask me anything about Rust.

This post will also help you all to setup Rust development environment on Windows which I will share later. Tools Required Install the latest appropriate Visual Studio 2019 Installer . Install Visual Studio Code ( lightweight editor which we can use for writing C/C++ & other languages code) Steps 1. Launch Visual Studio Installer & it will launch a dialog showing the Build Tool Workloads. Check the Desktop development with C++ workload (as shown in screenshot below) and then click on Install . I have also installed C++ Clang tools for Windows. 2. It might take a while to install all the selected tools depending your internet speed and your system. You might have to restart your system for the complete setup. 3. Click on Windows Start Menu & then type Developer and you should see the following screen ( as shown below). Click on Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019 ( depending upon your version) and launch it. 4. After launching the Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019 , we can test the installation of Microsoft Optimizing C/C++ Compiler , cl.exe by running the command cl (as shown in screenshot) 5. If everything is installed properly, then the cl command will show you the Microsoft C/C++ compiler message & version. 6. We have to use cl command ( cl.exe ) to compile & build C/C++ files which I will share in next tutorial. We will use lightweight text editor Visual Studio Code for the next tutorial ( it is different from Visual Studio IDE ).

Recently, I tried to retrieve comments on my Facebook Notes by using Facebook Note API, but I found that Note API had been depreciated and could not be used. I thought that I won't be able to get comments on my Facebook Notes . But, I finally found a way to do so after playing with API for some days. Many users may be trying to get all the comments on their Facebook Notes as Notes may contain many important links, tutorials,etc. This method can also be used for getting comments of Facebook Posts also. Facebook Notes can be considered similar to that of Facebook Posts. To get comments of any facebook Note/Post, we need its unique post-id whose prefix part is always profile-id_ and last part is numerical part of Note URL. You need to visit https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/ and get your Graph API Access Token for using Facebook Graph API Explorer.Just selelct all those permission which you want to use. Getting Facebook Profile Name & ID: Selecting any Facebook Note/Post and getting its last Numerical part of URL: Getting Facebook Note/Post post-id Now, we can easily form this Note post-id by adding profile-id and last numerical part of URL as shown in screenshot( profile-id +underscore + last numerical part of URL). By using the above method we can easily get Facebook Note ID .But, we have to do things manually each time for different posts/notes each time we want to retrieve comments. So, this method will inefficient.Thus, we should use different method as described below. Tools Required: 1. python 3 2. facebook-sdk ] (python module) you can easily install facebook-sdk by using pip as shown below: pip install facebook-sdk 3. FBNotes Download the above file and Extract it. Change your working directory to the directory where you extracted the files. Edit fb_notes.py with your access token & other options as described below , then run the python script as shown below. python fb_notes.py [Using facebook-sdk] If you see the second screenshot, you can see that I had created my Facebook Note on 10 February 2017. I have used that date in my code to get posts created on that day .Using this approach, we can limit time-period to get posts and their post-id. Thus, this approach makes work easy. You should use your own Facebook Note/Post date on which you created it. 1. Getting Facebook Profile Name & ID : import facebook token = \"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\" account_data = graph . get_object ( \"me\" ) print ( \"Name:\" , account_data [ \"name\" ]) print ( \"Profile ID: \" , account_data [ \"id\" ]) 2. Selecting Facebook Note/Post & Getting its post-id posts = graph . get_object ( \"me/feed?since=10 February 2017 & until=11 February 2017\" ) note_data = posts [ \"data\" ][ 0 ] print ( \"Post/Note Title: \" , note_data [ \"message\" ]) note_postid = note_data [ \"id\" ] print ( \"Post/ Note ID: \" , note_postid ) 3. Getting Comments & total number of comments # get comment data . Not all comments will be returned by facebook API comments_data = graph . get_object ( note_postid + \"/comments\" ) # get total number of comments comments_data = graph . get_object ( note_postid + \"?fields=comments.summary(true)\" ) comments_count = comments_data [ \"comments\" ][ \"summary\" ][ \"total_count\" ] print ( \"Post/Note Comments count: \" , comments_count ) 4. Getting total comments on Facebook Note/Post comments_data = graph . get_object ( note_postid + \"/comments?limit=\" + str ( comments_count )) cc = 0 print ( \"No.\" , \" \\t \" , \"Comment\" ) for comment in comments_data [ \"data\" ]: print ( cc , \" \" , comment [ \"message\" ]) cc += 1 Complete Code Now,edit your access token & other things as described above depending upon your requirements, then run the python script as shown below. Output : We can also save the comments in a file for later use.By using the above methods , we can get Facebook Notes/Posts comments and other data. I hope this post will be useful for them who want to use Facebook API & its python SDK. If you have any questions or you face any problem, please post them in comments. Thanks for reading the post.

I am setting up Apache2 Server on Ubuntu 16.04.You can do the same on your system easily by following my steps. Steps 1. Install Apache2: sudo apt install apache2 2. To start Apache2 server and test it (shown in screenshot): sudo systemctl start apache2 To check status: sudo systemctl status apache2 (Note: If you get any error in starting Apache2 then nginx or other server maybe running on system, so you can stop nginx by using this command: [sudo systemctl stop nginx] ) and rerun the same command to start apache2.On my system, nginx starts automatically on reboot, so I have to stop it,otherwise apache2 server won't start. if you see output as \"active (running)\" ,then apache2 server is running successfully.Now,if you access http://localhost/ in your browser, then you will see Apache2 Default Page. Optional To stop Apache2 server: sudo systemctl stop apache2 To restart Apache2 server: sudo systemctl restart apache2 3. Install Perl if it is not installed. sudo apt install perl 4. To enable CGI for Apache2: sudo a2enmod cgi sudo systemctl restart apache2 5. To write CGI files in /var/www/cgi-bin/ ,you need to use this command otherwise Apache2 will read CGI files from /usr/lib/cgi-bin/ : sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf This will open vi editor and lines will begin like this and we need to add the 3rd line given below(shown in screenshot) , and then save the file: ServerAdmin webmaster\\@localhost] DocumentRoot /var/www/html # Add this 3rd line without editing other lines(you can ignore my other extra lines or use them if you want ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/cgi-bin/ 6.Install MySQL if it is not installed (Remember MySQL password while installing as we need to use it later): sudo apt-get install mysql-server 7.To run PERL programs which uses MySQL, you may need to install DBI & DBD:mysql for PERL by using these commands: sudo cpan Now cpan prompt will appear.Type these on prompt: cpan \\> install DBI cpan \\> install DBD:mysql 8.To start MySQL server: sudo systemctl start mysql To check status of MySQL server: sudo systemctl status mysql if you see the output as \"active (running)\" , then MySQL server is running successfully. 9. To use PHP with Apache2: sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php 10. To enable PHP for apache2( change php7.0 with your version or just try 'php') : sudo a2enmod php7.0 sudo systemctl restart apache2 # For PHP7.0 sudo apt install php7.0-mbstring 11. To enable PHP to connect with MySQL, use this command: sudo apt install php-mysql 12. All the steps are complete now if all the previous steps are completed successfully .You need to place PERL CGI files in /var/www/cgi-bin/ directory so that you can access them in browser with URL http://localhost/cgi-bin/cgi.pl .You need to write HTML and PHP files in /var/www/html directory so that you can acesss them in browser with URL http://localhost/index.html Now, Apache2 Server is set up successfully for PERL CGI and PHP programming along with MySQL support on the system Thanks for reading the post.I hope this post has been helpful and easy to understand.If you have any question or you face any error,please post it in comments.","tags":"Linux, Networking, Ubuntu","url":"2017/11/11/how-to-set-up-apache2-server-for-perl-cgi-php-programming-with-mysql-server-support-on-linux-ubuntu-os","loc":"2017/11/11/how-to-set-up-apache2-server-for-perl-cgi-php-programming-with-mysql-server-support-on-linux-ubuntu-os"},{"title":"How to run and manage different versions of Python  with virtual environment support by using pyenv","text":"In this post,I am sharing how we can run different versions of python easily with virtual environment support by usng [pyenv] .I am using pyenv these days.I find it better than using virtualenv .

It allows the user to display TCP/IP and other packets being transmitted or received over a network to which the computer is attached. Distributed under the BSD license,tcpdump is free software. tcpdump works on most Unix-like operating systems: Linux, Solaris, BSD, OS X, HP-UX, Android and AIX among others. In those systems, tcpdump uses the libpcap library to capture packets. The port of tcpdump for Windows is called WinDump; it usesWinPcap, the Windows port of libpcap. tcpdump can be used for intercepting(capturing) the data packets sent by Android phone as it has Linux kernel. DOWNLOAD : tcpdump STEPS: 1.First trick: Download and move tcpdump script to /system/bin folder using file manager like Xplore File manager. Use Xplore or any Filemanager with \"Superuser + Mount\" mode for changing file permissions.Now,go to /system/bin/tcpdump file and change its permission to 777 as shown in screenshot. Note: Your /system folder must have read & write permission. Another trick: Consider that tcpdump script which i downloaded is in /sdcard/download folder.Then you can type these commands in terminal to copy file tcpdump to /system/bin and for changing file permission of tcpdump to 777 (see screnshot).Type these in terminal carefully as shown in screenshot: su mount -o remount,rw /system cp /sdcard/download/tcpdump /system/bin cd /system/bin chmod 777 tcpdump mount -o remount,ro /system 2.Now,you have succesfully placed tcpdump in /system/bin .To run tcpdump , simply type this on Terminal as shown in screenshot: tcpdump You can clearly see tcpdump running and all data packets sent on Terminal screen. If you want to save this log to a file l.cap for later analysis ,you can use this command in Terminal as shown in screenshot : tcpdump -vv -s 0 -w /sdcard/l.cap The options used are explained as: -vv : puts tcpdump into verbose mode -s 0 : sets the program to grab all packets -w : writes the output to a file The output file l.cap generated will be as shown in screenshot.This file can be analyzed application using Wireshark. Now,you successfully know how to use tcmpdump to intercept all data packets. Happy phreaking brothers. Thanks everyone for reading this post.Thanks to my friends and facebook groups where i learn.

To know how to do this, see my another post: Using SSH Tunnel on Android Phones to Hide your real IP details and to Access Blocked Websites I created SSH account on fastssh.com as shown in screenshot. 4.Now,open SSH Tunnel application and fill your user details and SSH account Host correctly as shown in screenshot.You can tick/enable \"SOCKS Proxy\" if you want to use it for forwarding Request from all ports.If your phone is rooted you can also enable/tick \"Global Proxy\" to proxify all apps. 5.Do not change other remaining settings of SSH Tunnel application.Leave other settings as it is.Minimise or close this app. 6.Now,use your simcard on which you want to use free internet.My simcard have 0(zero) balance which I will use for free internet.Now,I will connect internet using this sim . 7.Open Terminal application and change your directory to si folder where you have extracted those files in step 1.My si folder is located at /sdcard/si .So,i will type this on terminal to run the si.py file.Type these commands carefully and correctly: cd /sdcard/si su 8.Now run the si.py script using python command.If everything is correct, SInjector script will be running on your Terminal. It will ask for payload file location(default payload file is payload.ini which we will use),so type n and press enter key.See screenshot. 9.Now,script will ask you \"Do you want to disable debug?\", you can enter either y for YES or n for NO. It is your wish.See Screenshot 10.Now,script will ask \"Auto Replace 200 OK\", enter y *and press Enter key.The Script will show local port on which the script is accepting connections(in my Screenshot it is listening on port 9000 * ).Notice this port carefully as we will use this port in next step. 11.Now,open SSH Tunnel application again and Tick/Enable \" Upstream Proxy \" and Put this in \"Proxy \": 127.0.0.1:9000 as SInjector script is listening on port 9000(shown in screenshot).you use your port on which SInjector script is listening. 12.Everything is finally done now.Now,Click on \" Tunnel Switch \" in SSH Tunnel app and minimize it(send it to background). 13.Now,open the Terminal app which is already running.If everything is correct and your payload is working for free internet,you will get 200 Connection Established Response from SSH server as shown in my screenshot.

It enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. OpenVPN is an open-source software application that implements virtual private network (VPN) techniques for creating secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote access facilities. It uses a custom security protocol that utilizes SSL/TLS for key exchange. VPNs are mainly used for privacy and bypassing censorships.You can access blocked websites by using this. So,let us proceed.

It will ask for username & password. Fill username and password which we got from FreeVPN earlier. Tick \"Show Password\" to see password & \"Save Password\" to save password for later use as shown in screenshot. 6.If everything is fine ,you will get connected as shown in screenshot. Connected: SUCCESS \\ 7.You need to check latest username & passwords from http://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn .Passwords are updated everyday. 8. To ensure working of VPN,visit whoer.net in default web browser Google Chrome.You should see IP address of VPN server(see screenshot).you will see Hostname: xxx.vpnbook.com .It means VPN is successfully working. 9.Now,You can use OpenVPN on Android in this way & hide your real IP address to access blocked websites.
